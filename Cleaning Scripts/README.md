# Cleaning Process

1) Before starting the cleaning process make sure the "raw dataset" has been duplicated so there is always a record on file
2) Double check that the duplicate dataset which is the one you will be cleaning is identical to the raw dataset. Do this by counting the tables to make sure no tables are missing in the duplicated dataset, also use the COUNT function to count the number of rows in each table to confirm each table was duplicated fully.
3) The cleaning script will update the tables so double check the code to make sure each line is still applicable
4) Remember to modify the years in the dates section, if neccesary.
5) The cleaning scripts should be archived here after each cleaning process is completed.
6) Include the year and quarter in the title of the script
